Goya is a location driven social media application that lets users experience social network posts in person. Our project improves upon the social media experience by making it more real to a user. Posts on goya can be seen on a map, giving users a way to contextualize social media posts and relate to their community. Users are encouraged to visit posts in person by receiving points upon check-in; these points are akin to karma on reddit. The functionality of goya not only encourages community participation but also entices users to be more active and see the world around them.
